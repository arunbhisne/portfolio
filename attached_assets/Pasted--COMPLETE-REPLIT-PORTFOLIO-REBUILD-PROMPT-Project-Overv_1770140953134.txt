```
<H2>The AI-Native Product Designer</H2>

<Body Text - 3 short paragraphs>

I'm a behavior and systems architect who designs what AI does when we're not looking. Unlike traditional UX designers who create static interfaces, I architect autonomous systems by specifying how models, agents, and tools behave under real-world uncertainty.

My work spans **agent topologies** (orchestrating multi-agent workflows), **system prompts** (machine-addressable behavior contracts), **evaluation frameworks** (golden datasets and LLM-as-a-Judge rubrics), and **Glass Box UX** (reasoning traces and provenance visualization).

I bridge design thinking with engineering depth—owning specs, diagrams, JSON schemas, and eval pipelines alongside traditional UX deliverables. My goal: making AI systems intelligible, steerable, evaluable, and safe.

<Pull Quote - Highlighted>
"We're no longer designing for the machine—we're designing for what the machine does when we're not looking."
— Robb Wilson, AI Researcher

- Close button and backdrop click to close

### Typography
- Reduce heading sizes by 20-30% on mobile
- Increase body text to 16px minimum (avoid zoom on input focus)

### Layout
- All grids collapse to single column below 768px
- Increased padding and spacing for thumb-friendly taps
- Sticky CTAs at bottom of viewport on mobile

### Images
- Lazy load all images below the fold
- Serve responsive images (srcset with multiple sizes)
- Use WebP with fallback to JPG

### Forms
- Large input fields (min 44px height)
- Proper input types (email, tel) for mobile keyboards
- Clear error states below inputs

***

## Accessibility Requirements

### Keyboard Navigation
- All interactive elements accessible via Tab
- Skip to main content link
- Focus visible indicators (2px outline with accent color)
- Logical tab order

### Screen Readers
- Semantic HTML (header, nav, main, section, article, footer)
- ARIA labels for icon buttons
- Alt text for all images and diagrams
- Proper heading hierarchy (no skipped levels)

### Color Contrast
- All text meets WCAG AA (4.5:1 for normal, 3:1 for large)
- Test both light and dark modes
- Don't rely solely on color for meaning

### Motion
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion
- Disable animations for users who prefer reduced motion
- Provide alternative static states

## Summary

Build a **world-class, engineering-grade portfolio** that positions me as an **AI-Native Product Designer**—not a traditional UX designer. The portfolio should:

1. **Immediately differentiate** my role (behavior architect, not interface designer)
2. **Showcase technical depth** (system prompts, agent topologies, evals, schemas)
3. **Demonstrate real projects** with engineering-grade artifacts
4. **Educate visitors** on what AI-native design means
5. **Be performant, accessible, and beautiful** (minimalist, modern, classic aesthetic)
6. **Convert visitors** with clear CTAs and compelling case studies
7. **Reflect my unique positioning** at the intersection of design and AI systems engineering

This portfolio should make hiring managers and technical teams say: *"This is exactly the type of designer we need for our AI products."*
