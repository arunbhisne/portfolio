Create a minimalist, modern, classic designer portfolio website for an AI-Native Product Designer with the following specifications:

About the Role & Professional Identity:
I'm an AI-Native Product Designer - a behavior and systems architect who designs probabilistic, agentic AI systems. Unlike traditional UX designers who create static interfaces, I architect autonomous systems by specifying system prompts, agent topologies, evaluation frameworks, and generative UI schemas that make AI systems transparent, steerable, and safe in production.

Design Direction:
Style: Minimalist, modern, classic designer aesthetic

Visual Language: Clean, professional, engineering-grade precision with design sophistication

Color Palette: Neutral tones (blacks, whites, grays) with subtle accent colors for hierarchy

Typography: Sans-serif, clean hierarchy (suggest Inter, Space Grotesk, or similar modern typeface)

Layout: Grid-based, spacious, generous white space, Brutalist/Swiss design influences

Interaction: Subtle animations, smooth transitions, professional polish

Core Sections to Include:
1. Hero Section

Name: Arun Bhisne

Tagline: "AI-Native Product Designer | Behavior & Systems Architect"

Subtitle: "Designing probabilistic AI systems that are transparent, steerable, and safe"

CTA: "View Work" and "Get in Touch"

2. About Section
Explain the AI-Native Product Designer role:

"I design for what AI does when we're not looking"

Architect probabilistic behaviors, not fixed interfaces

Specialize in agent topologies, system prompts, evaluation frameworks, and generative UI

Bridge design thinking with engineering depth

3. Core Competencies (5 Domain Cards)
Display as interactive cards or sections:

Probabilistic Behavior & Failure Design - Designing for uncertainty, hallucinations, and failure modes

Orchestration & Agent Topologies - Multi-agent systems, router logic, autonomy matrices

System Prompting & Generative UI - Component ontologies, JSON schemas, machine-addressable design

Evaluation Design & Behavioral Metrics - Golden datasets, evals, LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks

Observability & Reasoning Traces - Glass Box UX, provenance, developer debugging interfaces

4. Skills & Deliverables
Two-column comparison showing evolution:

Traditional UX Deliverables → AI-Native Engineering-Grade Deliverables

Examples: Wireframes → Agent topology diagrams; Components → Component ontologies & JSON schemas; Error states → Failure-mode trees

5. Projects Section (Portfolio Case Studies)
Include placeholders for 3 key projects:

Project 1: Agentic Customer Service Agent (orchestration, observability, HITL)

Project 2: Uncertainty & Recovery Patterns (probabilistic outputs, trust-building)

Project 3: Generative UI Co-Pilot (streaming, memory-driven context)

Each project card should show: Title, description, tech stack, key outcomes

6. Process/Approach Section
Visualize the AI-Native design process:

From intent modeling → agent topology → system prompts → evaluation design → observability

Show how traditional design thinking integrates with engineering rigor

7. Contact Section

Email, LinkedIn, GitHub, Kaggle

Clear CTA: "Let's build the future of human-AI interaction together"

Form or direct contact options

Technical Requirements:
Responsive: Mobile-first, works beautifully on all devices

Performance: Fast loading, optimized images

Accessibility: WCAG AA compliant, semantic HTML

Animations: Scroll-triggered reveals, smooth hover states, subtle parallax

Framework: Use modern stack (React/Next.js preferred, vanilla JS acceptable)

Components: Modular, reusable component architecture

Navigation: Sticky header with smooth scroll anchors

Special Features to Include:
Interactive Agent Topology Diagram - Animated visualization showing sequential/hierarchical agent structures

Skill Matrix Visual - Interactive table/grid showing traditional skill → AI-native evolution

Testimonial/Research Citations - Pull quotes from key researchers (Robb Wilson: "We're no longer designing for the machine—we're designing for what the machine does when we're not looking")

Resource Links - Curated links to key frameworks (Microsoft HAX, Vercel AI SDK, LangGraph, Model Context Protocol)

Content Tone:
Professional yet approachable

Engineering-precise but design-minded

Forward-thinking, emerging role positioning

Authoritative but not arrogant

Emphasize systems thinking, behavioral architecture, transparency

Optional Enhancements:
Dark mode toggle

Project filtering by competency domain

Downloadable resume/framework PDF

Blog/writing section for thought leadership

Case study deep-dive pages

Build this portfolio to showcase a designer who thinks like an engineer and builds like a product architect - someone operating at the intersection of design, AI systems, and behavioral engineering.
