🚀 Strategic Improvements to Elevate the Portfolio
1. Hero Section Enhancement
Current: Basic text layout with CTA buttons

Improvement:

text
Add a subtle animated visual element that demonstrates AI-Native concepts:

- Animated node graph showing agent topology (Sequential → Hierarchical transformation)
- Subtle particle system representing probabilistic outputs
- Animated JSON schema snippet that morphs/updates
- Interactive "AB" monogram that reveals system prompt structure on hover

Purpose: Immediately demonstrate "I don't just talk about this—I think visually about systems"
Replit Prompt Addition:

text
In the hero section, add a subtle SVG animation below the tagline:
- Create an animated network diagram with 3-4 nodes representing agents
- Nodes should pulse gently and connect with animated lines
- Use CSS keyframe animations for smooth, continuous motion
- Keep it minimal (single color, line-based) to not overwhelm
- Should work in both light and dark modes
2. About Section - Add Visual Proof
Current: Text-heavy with four feature boxes

Improvement:

text
Add a small "Design Artifact Showcase" section showing actual deliverables:

- Mini preview of an agent topology diagram (Mermaid/SVG)
- Snippet of a system prompt in monospace font
- JSON schema preview with syntax highlighting
- Small eval dashboard mockup

Visual proof > Claims
Replit Prompt:

text
In the About section, after the four feature boxes, add a "Sample Artifacts" horizontal scroll:
- Create 3-4 cards showing code/diagram snippets
- Card 1: Agent Topology (simple node diagram in SVG)
- Card 2: System Prompt (monospace code block with syntax highlighting)
- Card 3: JSON Schema (formatted JSON with collapsible sections)
- Each card should be clickable to expand in a modal
- Use horizontal scroll on mobile, grid on desktop
3. Core Competencies - Make Interactive
Current: Static cards with tags

Improvement:

text
Add interactivity to demonstrate depth:

- Hover on competency card → Reveals 2-3 sub-skills with micro-descriptions
- Click on tags (e.g., "Multi-Agent") → Opens tooltip with definition
- Progress indicators showing your proficiency level (e.g., 4/5 stars)
- Link each competency to relevant project case study

This shows: "I understand these concepts at working depth"
Replit Prompt:

text
Make Core Competencies section interactive:
- On hover, each numbered card should expand slightly with smooth transition
- Show a "Learn More" link that scrolls to the related project
- Add small icons for each competency (use Lucide React or similar)
- Tags should have hover tooltips with 1-sentence definitions
- Add subtle entrance animations (stagger delay for cards 01-05)
4. Skills Evolution - Enhance Visual Contrast
